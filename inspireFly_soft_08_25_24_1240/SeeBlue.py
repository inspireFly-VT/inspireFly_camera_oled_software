#Program reads set of images and runs through them to determine the percentage of the image that is blue
#the program then compares the percentages and determines which image of the selection has the highest percentage of blue
#the respective image is labeled with a 1 and the directory is output in the command shell
#Ideally, this algorithm will automatically determine images taken (internal counter) and then automatically send the best
#image to be transmit to ground
#Should also not decide best picture, but optimal percentage of blue for an ideal image
